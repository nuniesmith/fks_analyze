# Expanded Standard AI Chat Prompts for Codebase Management

This is an expanded version of the previous Markdown document. I've reviewed the provided repo list again (noting the mix of private and public repos, languages like Python, Rust, C#, TypeScript, Shell, HTML, Jupyter Notebook, Java, and Batchfile; focus on MIT licenses; recent updates; and themes around "fks_" for core services, "shared_" for DRY utilities, "personal_games_" for games, and "personal_services/servers_" for personal tools). The expansion includes:

- New categories: Testing & Quality Assurance, Security & Compliance, Scaling & Deployment, Collaboration & Version Control.
- Additional prompts in existing categories for better coverage (e.g., more on Kubernetes prep, API integrations).
- Emphasis on handling up to 32 repos, promoting DRY by prioritizing shared repos (e.g., `shared_docker`, `shared_scripts`, `shared_schema`), and easing new project rollouts.
- Prompts now include more placeholders for specificity and reminders to reference the full repo ecosystem.

As before, use these as templatesâ€”fill in placeholders and prepend with context if needed.

## General Guidelines for Using These Prompts
- **Context Inclusion**: Prepend with "My repos: [brief list or summary, e.g., fks_api (Python service), shared_docker (Shell for containers), personal_games_clonehero (Python game), etc. Up to 32 repos total."
- **DRY Focus**: Always encourage moving common code/configs to shared repos.
- **Tech Stack Reminder**: "Stack: Docker/Docker Compose (K8s future); langs: Python, Rust, C#, Node.js/JS/TS/React, HTML/CSS, shell scripts, plus Jupyter, Java, Batchfile in some repos."
- **Scalability**: For larger tasks, mention "considering scale across 32+ repos."
- **Update Handling**: If repos change, note recent update times (e.g., many updated 5 hours ago).

## 1. Code Review and Refactoring Prompts
(Expanded with prompts for API-specific reviews and dependency management.)

- **General Code Review**:
  ```
  Review the following code from [REPO_NAME] ([LANGUAGE]): [PASTE_CODE_HERE]. Suggest improvements for performance, readability, and DRY principles.
